# simple-php-login
A simple PHP login engine with three scripts - one for logging in, one for checking the login, and one for logging out.

# How to Use
Preferably, the three scripts should all be in the same file, with the connection PHP script (if a separate file) in that same folder.  `login.php` and `logout.php` are form actions, while `login_status.php` is an included file in your PHP page.
